            <h6>Will you make plates with an illegal spacing?</h6>
            <hr>
            <p>To mid-space or misrepresent the digits on number plates is an offence under the RoadVehiles
                (Registration & Licensing) Regulation 1975. Regardless of how you enter the spacing in your order, we
                will space the digits legally and the plates you order will be despatched with the correct & legal
                spacing of digits</p>

            <h6>Fitting Kits</h6>
            <hr>
            <p>We do not drill the number plates, as each car has the holes in a different place, our fitting kit
                unclues 10 sticky pads (5 for each plate) and a selection of coloured screws (2x black, 2x yellow and 2x
                white) if you'd like to drill the plates yourself, we'd recommend using a drill with a 3mm drill head.
                All this is for the great value of Â£5.</p>
